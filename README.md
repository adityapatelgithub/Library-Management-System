# Library-Management-System
I started learning Java last week. This is my first project using Java. I am so proud of it that I decided to upload this project. If you are interested to check out my project, clone the repository. I used NetBeans for this project. 
Notes:
1) I used SQL for this project to store important information. You would have to change the location of SQL in JavaConnect class.
2) I used the following jars (which you might need to install):
   sqlitejdbc-v056.jar
   JTattoo-1.6.11.jar
   DateChooser.jar
   rs2xml.jar
